# CorrelationGraphs

This notebook was used to create the correlation graphs and heatmaps seen in the report. It also processes and extracts image features, saving them along with environmental data to a CSV file.

If you need to run the notebook, **the data location has changed**. Use the `Data` folder instead of the current directory, as file paths were updated for uploading to GitLab.

Example:
```python
pd.read_csv("Data/data_with_camera_info.csv")
